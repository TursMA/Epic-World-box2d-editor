Epic World editor
================
A minimalist Box2D world editor that just wants to provide enough functionalities.  
We don't need to reinvent the feature to edit bodies, this tool is designed to be used in conjuction with [Physics Body Editor](http://code.google.com/p/box2d-editor/)!  
  
Essential functionalities completed, including import/export, moving, scaling, undo/redo. It's now ready to be used!  

Binary distribution of version 1.0 alpha for Windows can be downloaded [here](http://ubuntuone.com/0WImWYvLHfXr3v0ArzmrtP).  
For linux, running the code is very easy, just install PyQt5 (package `python3-pyqt5` on Ubuntu) and run `python3 epicworld.py`.
