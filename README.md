Epic World editor
================
A Box2D world editor that is as simple and stupid as possible.  
Merely a world editor, just enough is enough, we don't need the feature to edit bodies. This tool is designed to be used in conjuction with [Physics Body Editor](http://code.google.com/p/box2d-editor/)!
Early stage, in heavy development, and needs your help.
